## Inspiration-  Technology is overwhelming for many people, causing **technophobia** in some, and it will only get more advanced. As a result, many people will be unable to **reap** the benefits of technology. In order to bridge the **GAP** between people and technology, the **educational** application **GAP Tech** was created.

## What it does- GAP Tech aims to educate the technology-averse and technophobic individuals to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of different technologies and ways to integrate technology into one's life to be more **productive** and **efficient**.

## How we built it- We built the app in dart. Utilized Flutter's UI toolkit. Leveraged Android Studio as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for the android version of the app.

## Challenges we ran into- Due to our low-end laptops we were unable to run our application in Android Studio. Due to this inconvenience, we were limited to a google slides presentation. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of- Foremost, we are most proud of the completion of our project because we dedicated tireless hours of research to our project and we got to see our hard work pay off in the form of a practical real-world project.

## What we learned- Within the project, we learned that technophobia affects a larger population. During the application process of the project, running the emulator challenged the laptop to the point of crashing. 

## What's next for GAP Tech
-Revenue/ monetization
-developing the API (Google analytics upper cache), 
-using PHP and SQL to build the server side of the app
creating permanent illustrations for the app
